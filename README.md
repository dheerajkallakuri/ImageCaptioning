# Image Captioning with Visual Attention

## Learning Objectives

1. **Create an Image Captioning Model**: Learn how to build a model that generates descriptive captions for images.
2. **Train and Predict Text Generation**: Understand the process of training a model to generate text and evaluate its predictions.

## Overview

Image captioning involves generating textual descriptions for images. The goal is to create a model that can output accurate and relevant captions for various images, akin to how a human might describe them.

For instance, given an image of people playing baseball, the model should generate a caption like "Some people are playing baseball."

## Model Architecture

In this notebook, we will build an attention-based image captioning model inspired by the architecture from the paper "Show, Attend and Tell: Neural Image Caption Generation with Visual Attention." This approach involves an encoder-decoder framework:

- **Encoder**: Processes the input image and generates an embedding representation.
- **Decoder**: Takes the image embedding and generates the textual description.

## Notebook Features

- **End-to-End Example**: The notebook provides a complete walkthrough of building, training, and evaluating an image captioning model.
- **Visual Attention Mechanism**: Incorporates attention mechanisms to enhance caption generation by focusing on relevant parts of the image.
